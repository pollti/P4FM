	volume = {4},
	abstract = {The spectral subtraction method is a well-known noise reduction technique. Most implementations and variations of the basic technique advocate subtraction of the noise spectrum estimate over the entire speech spectrum. However, real world noise is mostly colored and does not affect the speech signal uniformly over the entire spectrum. In this paper, we propose a multi-band spectral subtraction approach which takes into account the fact that colored noise affects the speech spectrum differently at various frequencies. This method outperforms the standard power spectral subtraction method resulting in superior speech quality and largely reduced musical noise.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new audio forensics method based on background noise in the audio signals. The traditional speech enhancement algorithms improve the quality of speech signals, however, existing methods leave traces of speech in the removed noise. Estimated noise using these existing methods contains traces of speech signal, also known as leakage signal. Although this speech leakage signal has low SNR, yet it can be perceived easily by listening to the estimated noise signal, it therefore cannot be used for audio forensics applications. For reliable audio authentication, a better noise estimation method is desirable. To achieve this goal, a two-step framework is proposed to estimate the background noise with minimal speech leakage signal. A correlation based similarity measure is then applied to determine the integrity of speech signal. The proposed method has been evaluated for different speech signals recorded in various environments. The results show that it performs better than the existing speech enhancement algorithms with significant improvement in terms of SNR value.},
